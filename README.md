# NLP-Text-Classification-System-Using-FastAPI-and-Multi-Modal-Approaches

This project is a modular NLP-based text classification system designed to classify user-provided text using multiple Natural Language Processing techniques. The system exposes machine learning models through a FastAPI-powered RESTful backend and delivers real-time predictions via REST APIs. The application integrates traditional NLP approaches such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec along with supervised classification logic inspired by transformer-based models. It allows users to test and compare predictions from different NLP techniques through well-structured API routes. The backend follows a clean, scalable architecture with clear separation between routing, schema validation, and model logic. This makes the system easy to extend with new models, datasets, or storage layers in the future.

This project demonstrates practical understanding of NLP workflows, API-based model deployment, and backend system design.

**Objectives of the Project :**

- To build a RESTful API for NLP text classification
- To implement and compare multiple NLP techniques
- To deploy NLP models using FastAPI
- To design a modular and scalable backend architecture
- To enable real-time text classification through APIs


**NLP Model Layer :**
- TF-IDF Model: Feature-based traditional NLP approach
- Word2Vec Model: Semantic embedding-based classification
- Supervised / BERT Logic: Rule-based placeholder for transformer fine-tuning
